        After sixteen days of matches Magnus Carlsen emerged as the champion of the Magnus Carlsen Invitational. Organized by
        Carlsen and several other chess entities, it featured a $250,000 total prize pool--$70,000 of which went to Carlsen--and 
        invited seven other professional chess players from across the globe.<br><br>The contestants played online and broadcasted 
        each game live to a team of commentators on Twitch.tv. During its most watched match (the grand finals between Hikaru Nakamura 
        and Magnus Carlsen) the stream reached 114,000 viewers.
