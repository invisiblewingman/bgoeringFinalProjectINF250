        <h2>US Women's National Soccer Team receives damaging judgment in court</h2> 
    <img src="/images/uswntheadimage.jpg" alt="Team photo of the US Womens National Soccer Team">   
        <a href="https://www.ussoccer.com/teams/uswnt" target="_blank">In a disappointing turn for the USWNT</a>, Gary Klausner, a federal judge, dismissed an important claim in the equal pay lawsuit
        that's been four years in the making. While the team intends to pursue the case further, the team must now find support
        in an appeal to court, which will take more time to set up.<br><br>The case presented by the USWNT argues that despite
        performing better than the men's national team, the women are paid less than the men. Further complications to the case include
        the fact that the players collectively bargained for payment contracts that prioritize different benefits over the bonuses
        that make players on the men's team most of their money.
